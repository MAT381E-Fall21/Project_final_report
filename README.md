# Getting ready for finals

1. Select a time slot for your final oral presentation at [Presentation Time slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HrApQ2KHJcj4GnpPXSNZbmDIMrM7V-XsLmsNoIIyYE8/edit#gid=796203822).

2. This repository consists of two main `R Markdown` files such as:

   * Final report and
   * Oral Presentation.  
  
3. Submit all source files (including `.Rmd` files) just before
your oral presentation (January 29, 2022 or January 30, 2022).

4. Do not forget to submit your peer evaluation forms which require **different** [GitHub submission](https://github.com/MAT381E-Fall21/Peer_evaluation) **as an individual study**.

5. Make this repository public and deploy your final report at GitHub pages (you have to do
required actions before publishing).

6. Under **About** section (top-right) of your projects, on the **topics** bar type your data source and most commonly used packages such as 
"UNDP, ggplot2" so that other people can find your repo on GitHub.

7. Please provide url address of your final project deployed at GitHub pages
in this [Google Sheet form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HrApQ2KHJcj4GnpPXSNZbmDIMrM7V-XsLmsNoIIyYE8/edit#gid=0).
